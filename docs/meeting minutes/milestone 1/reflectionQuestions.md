    I want to improve the effectiveness of my research.

What excites you most about this project?
The opportunity to work together with my fellow classmates! It's going to be awesome to learn how to construct an actual piece of software as a team and understand the process.

What is one thing you want to improve this milestone?
I wish I could understand further the cost of each of our planned tasks. It's hard to estimate how much time a task will take without having any experience implementing anything like it in the past. So I guess the thing I'd want to improve is my knowledge of the process.

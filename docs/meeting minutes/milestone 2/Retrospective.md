What went well:
The meeting and planning went well for this milestone! We were all able to use our meeting times effectively! We knew what we needed to be doing!

What could have been improved.
Maybe more coordination when merging everybodies code. There were issues with evey merge that resulted in more time being spent resolving the kinks near the end of the milestone.

Actionable steps for the next milestone.
Coordinate how each of our tasks might cause conflict with eachothers work. Focus on smoothing out the merging of all of our code.

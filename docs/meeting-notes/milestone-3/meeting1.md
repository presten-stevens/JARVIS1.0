# Friday Feburary 21st, 2025
Remote Teams Meeting

## Attendance
- [ ] Ben Oakeson
- [x] Presten Stevens 
- [x] Adam Sellers
- [x] Joshua LeVar (Scrum Master)


## Action Plan

1. Get all design, diagrams, and planning done by Tuesday 2/25. 
2. The work will be split into two teams:
  - Joshua and Adam: Mockups/Wireframe
  - Preston and Ben: UML Diagrams
3. Meet Tuesday 2/25 to:
  - Finalize design documents and project structure
  - Split up work for test writing and implementation
    - *Idea*: Everone writes tesk for one task and then implements another task
    - That way we get two eyes on every task, and we prioritize test writing
4. Finish coding by Tuesday 3/4
5. Finalize sprint by Thursday 3/6 deadline

## Decisions

- We will use the Tkinter python library to create GUI
- **UNDECIDED** - Style Standardization
  - Most notably camelCase or snake_case?
 
## Final Notes
This was a good productive meeting where we created a detailed action plan for the next course of action. I think we made good progress in addressing some of the missteps of previous sprints, and I believe everyone is on the same page.

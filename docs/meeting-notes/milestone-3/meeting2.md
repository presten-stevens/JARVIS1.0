## Agenda
1. Finalize UML diagrams
    - Be sure all final diagrams are sourced in the [images folder](/docs/images/) and linked in the [SRS](/docs/SRS.md)
2. Decide on final GUI design from wireframe proposals
    - [Joshua's proposal](/docs/images/TaskmasterWireframeJoshua.png)

    -Use Adams layout. Take Joshua's idea of adding dates to the bottom of the task and impelment into Adams wireframe. Also add the save button. We'll also use Joshua's idea of having a completed tab for tasks.

3. Determine needed test cases and distribute evenly

    - Test if backend data matches gui visualization (actual gui, visual list)
        -Task list is showing every JSON task file (Ben & Josh)
    - Test button functionality (with dummy gui)
        -Add, delete, save(onl effect backend), load automatically on startup (Preston & Adam)

4. Randomly each of the four GUI [tasks](/docs/milestone3Outline.md) among us 
5. Discuss any other pressing issues

## Proposed Schedule
- Friday 2/28: All test cases written
- Tuesday 3/4: All code written
- Thursday 3/6: Finalize sprint for submission

# Milestone 5 Reflections

## Joshua LeVar
I learned a lot from this project. I'm most proud that we were able to work as a team and complete a project.
However, this was prety challenging. Our biggest challenges were finding time to collaborate, as well as designing
and planning the project prior to implementation. We overcame the meeting time issue by just having multiple small
meetings and using our group chat and Teams to coordinate the rest. The design challenges were dealt with on a case
by case basis, but we got better at planning as the semester went on. The most valuable lesson I learned is that making
a good, sustainable codebase is not easy. It takes a ton of care and detail to keep everything organized. I believe that
collobration contributed to the project's success by being a collection of many people's ideas and viewpoints. This isn't
just a piece of software made by one and meant to be used by one. This is software that was designed by many people and
thus is made with more than one person's interests in mind.

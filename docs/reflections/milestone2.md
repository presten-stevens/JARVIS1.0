# Milestone 2 Reflections

## Benjamin Oakeson
What went well:
The meeting and planning went well for this milestone! We were all able to use our meeting times effectively! We knew what we needed to be doing!

What could have been improved.
Maybe more coordination when merging everybodies code. There were issues with evey merge that resulted in more time being spent resolving the kinks near the end of the milestone.

Actionable steps for the next milestone.
Coordinate how each of our tasks might cause conflict with eachothers work. Focus on smoothing out the merging of all of our code.

What did you learn about Test-Driven Development (TDD)?
- I learned that test-driven development can really simplify the process of implementing a function. Coming up with test cases during the implementation can be really distracting and creates a temptation to only haphazardly test the code.

What was the most challenging part of implementing the CLI?
- The most challenging part was bringing all of our pieces together. I think we could have done a better job of planning and detailing specifics before we each coded our sections of it. For instance, self.tasks was initially a list but was reimplemented into a dictionary. Luckily it was only a minor detail, but it did require me to rewrite my section of the code to account for that.

What went well?
- We were able to keep meetings short and efficient. We delegated jobs and tasks evenly, and ultimately made good progress in creating a product that didn't exist two weeks ago.

What could have been improved?
- I think we could have been much more meticulous and thorough in our planning. We overlooked many implementation details that we should have determined before coding. We also didn't properly account for all the deliverables at the beginning, forcing us to cram at the end.

Actionable steps for the next milestone?
- Put a stronger emphasis on planning
- Prioritize test cases first
- Standardize style throughout codebase 
  - Fix inconsistent use of case (snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase, etc)
  - Fix inconsistent use of comments, and type hints.
- Create uniform, neat, and informative documentation

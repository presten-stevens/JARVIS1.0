# Milestone 2 Reflections

## Adam Sellers

What excites you most about this project?
- I am most excited for the opportunity to learn new skills and to create a program that I can place on my resume.
- I am especially excited for the opportunity to learn front-end development.

What is one thing you want to improve this milestone?
- I want to improve the effectiveness of my research. 
- Because I will need to learn how to flask and react, it will be imperative that I find great, informative resources to learn from.

## Joshua LeVar
What excites you most about this project?
- What excited me the most is getting the chance to work with a team to create software. Almost all of my CS experience has been solo programming, so learning how to create and collaborate with a group is exciting.

What is one thing you want to improve this milestone?
- I want to improve my planning skills. I’ve always found the easiest way to create something is to just start first and refactor later. But with Software Engineering, since it’s important to plan first, it’s a skill that feels underdeveloped.


## Ben Oakeson
What excites you most about this project?
- The opportunity to work together with my fellow classmates! It's going to be awesome to learn how to construct an actual piece of software as a team and understand the process.

What is one thing you want to improve this milestone?
- I wish I could understand further the cost of each of our planned tasks. It's hard to estimate how much time a task will take without having any experience implementing anything like it in the past. So I guess the thing I'd want to improve is my knowledge of the process.
